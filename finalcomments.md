There are two avenues of interactivity here, and they both...produce an effect. While it might have been nice to get some sense of what you can do with the site without having to read the code, you did have two means of interaction that produced an effect.

# Code Quality
You accomplished what you needed to accomplish in few lines of code, which is great. The way that you loaded and used your images could be improved: just using a single img variable for multiple images isn't the best approach.

# Aesthetics
Little pieces of art(?) like this exist all over the internet, and this absolutely fits right in. You too can be an internet artist.
